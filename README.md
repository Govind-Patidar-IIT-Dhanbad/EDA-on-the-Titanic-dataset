# EDA-on-the-Titanic-dataset
Methodology:
To conduct the EDA, I began by acquiring the Titanic dataset, which contained information on passengers such as their age, gender, class, fare, and survival status. I employed Python programming language and data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore and manipulate the data effectively. Initially, I performed data cleaning tasks, handling missing values and outliers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

Findings and Analysis:
Throughout the project, I explored various aspects of the Titanic dataset, examining the relationship between factors such as age, gender, class, and survival rates. By employing statistical measures and visualization techniques such as bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots, I was able to uncover significant patterns and correlations. For instance, I discovered that women and children had higher survival rates compared to men. Additionally, the analysis revealed that passengers traveling in higher-class cabins had a better chance of survival.
